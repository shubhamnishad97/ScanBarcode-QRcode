I completed the Udacity andriod course and decided to make my own app.

Reasons to make the Scanner app :
* The idea did not looked complex for a beginner to implement.
* I already knew a barcode scanner library which was pretty popular.
* All the similar apps on playstore had AD'S and I wanted a AD free version.
* The UI of these apps was also old, not updated for a time now so a Material Design solution was needed.


The libraries or resources used:
* [Zxing-android-embedded](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded): really easy to use and does what it says very efficently.
* [cupboard](https://bitbucket.org/littlerobots/cupboard): makes SQL vey simple. you should atleast read it usage. [Read this for more info](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Easier-SQL-with-Cupboard)
* [CodePath Android Cliffnotes](http://guides.codepath.com/android): A crowdsourced resource for complete and up-to-date practical Android developer guides for any topic.
* youtube also helped as always.


Things I learned and implemented:
* RecyclerView with swipe actions.
* Database connectivity using SQLite.
* SharedPreferences.
* Intents.
* Countless hours of debugging and wow moments.
